      <h1>Who am < I >?</h1>

      <h2>Who am I</h2>
      <p>I am Full Stack Developer having worked for 9 years in the healthcare industry as a Registered nurse and a CQC Registered Manager in Harley Street. I have recently graduated from Le Wagon Coding School, the worlds number 1 ranked coding school. It’s a Full Stack Ruby on Rails bootcamp where I worked in teams to build and ship real web applications to production.
      My years working as a nurse has taught me to unrivalled communication skills and how to work under pressure. Most importantly, making big decisions, individually and in teams. I am extremely excited about my future as a programmer and believe my previous experience can add value to any dev team and company I join. I enjoy learning new technologies and am eager to take on complicated and challenging development projects.
